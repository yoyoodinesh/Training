## Validation of the User Login.

#### DESCRIPTION

Project objective:

* Create a servlet-based web application that shows a login page and validates it. 
* The correct values are hard-coded. 
* On successful login, a dashboard page is shown. 
* The dashboard will provide a link for logging out. 
* Incorrect logins need to be handled by showing an error message page.

 

Background of the problem statement:

* As a part of developing an e-commerce web application, you have to prototype a login scenario for the user. 
* There is no database involved here, so you have to use fixed values for login email id and password.

 

You must use the following:

* Eclipse as the IDE
* Apache Tomcat as the web server
* HTML pages for the front end
* Servlets for backend processing
 

Following requirements should be met:

* Show a login form in HTML
* Handle invalid logins and show appropriate error messages using servlets
* Show the dashboard page using servlets
* Handle logouts using servlets
* Document the step-by-step process involved in completing this task
