#### DESCRIPTION

* Create a servlet-based web application that shows a form to enter product details. 
* Capture the details in a servlet and then display the data that was entered.

Background of the problem statement:
* As a part of developing an ecommerce web application, you have to prototype a form for adding products into the system entered by the users. 
* There is no database involved here, so the product is just captured and displayed without storing it anywhere.

You must use the following:

* Eclipse as the IDE
* Apache Tomcat as the web server
* JSP pages for the front end
* Servlets for backend processing

Following requirements should be met:

* There will be a Product class to store the details of the product
* The servlet will put the form data into the Product class and store it in the session
* A second JSP will take the product info from the session and display it to the user
* The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented
